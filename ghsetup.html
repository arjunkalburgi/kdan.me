	<h3>This is how to set up gh-pages to run your own website!</h3>
	<ol>
	<div>
		<li>First make a new repository on <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a>.
		Your website will take the url "username.github.io/repository_name"</li>
		<li>Create a new branch with the name "gh-pages". At this point you may make it 
		the default branch if you want and delete "master" but you don't have to.</li>
		<li>Next, clone the repository to your computer.</li>
		<li>Switch the branch in the github app to be gh-pages. This option is near the top left of the app</li>
		<li>Navigate to the cloned repo on your computer. In this folder, create a file named "index.html"</li>
		<li>Make the website however you want, when you are done head back to the github app. Commit and sync your changes</li>
		<li>Your website is now published as you have made it!</li>
	</div>
	</ol>

<h4>To view the url where your website is published at, navigate to the repo on github, then click settings.<br>
About halfway down, it will tell you "Your website is published at xxx"</h4>
